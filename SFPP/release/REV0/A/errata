* 1V2_0 Tracks to L1 and from L1 to VDD12_0 too thin. 10 mil not spec'd to carry estimated 3A.

* 1V2_1 Tracks to L4 and from L4 to VDD12_1 too thin. 10 mil not spec'd to carry estimated 3A.

* 1V8_0 Tracks to L2 and from L2 to VDD18_0 too thin. 10 mil not spec'd to carry estimated 800mA.

* 1V8_1 Tracks to L5 and from L5 to VDD18_1 too thin. 10 mil not spec'd to carry estimated 800mA.

* R19 is currently a NOPOP. Need to verify this.

* R65 is indicated as NOPOP on cct. Must be listed on BOM or assembly diagram.

* U8 part number on BOM must indicate 2V5 option. Last order was for 3V3. Check partnumbers and alternatives for BOM.

* R67 should be 3K6 1% and R68 should be 1K6 1% for 2V5 regulator.

* TX and RX led's. Currently only displaying RX status. Possibly OR the two? Will need to route one GPIO with TX capability per channel. GPIO 6 and 8 available.

* VDDMDIO and VDDTTL levels? Henno will check with Vitesse.
