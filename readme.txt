This repository contains the various daughter card designs that mate with ROACH2's high-speed MGT mezzanine connector.

Contents:
SFPP -- a 4 x SFP+ 10GbE connector board, driven by two dual Vitesse PHYs.
CX4  -- a 3 x CX4 port connector board, purely passive. Due to rear panel space constraints, the fourth port is available as a header for internal connection.
